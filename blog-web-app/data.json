    ".Next.js supports CSS Modules using the [name].module.css file naming convention. CSS Modules locally scope CSS by automatically creating a unique class name. This allows you to use the same CSS class name in different files without worrying about collisions. This behavior makes CSS Modules the ideal way to include component-level CSS. CSS Module files can be imported anywhere in your application.For example, consider a reusable Button component in the components/ folderNext.js supports CSS Modules using the [name].module.css file naming convention.

    "We are going to keep all information in files on the local filesystem. The two types of content, posts and authors, will use different types of files. The text-heavy posts will use Markdown, allowing for an easier editing process. Because the information on authors is lighter, we will keep that in JSON files. Helper functions will make reading different file types and combining their content easier.We are going to keep all information in files on the local filesystem.

    "By picking the “batteries included” Next.js, we can focus on our application itself. We don’t have to spend any time on the repetitive groundwork new projects often come with. Instead of building everything by hand, we can rely on the tested and proven framework. The large and active community behind Next.js makes it easy to get help if we run into issues along the way.By picking the “batteries included” Next.js, we can focus on our application itself.
